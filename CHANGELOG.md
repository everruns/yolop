# Changelog

All notable user-visible changes to yolop are recorded here.

The format follows the [release spec](./specs/release.md): one section per
released version, newest first, with a `### Highlights` summary, an optional
`### Breaking Changes` block (required for MINOR/MAJOR with breakage), and a
mechanical `### What's Changed` list of merged PRs.

The first tagged release will be cut via [`/release`](./.agents/skills/release/SKILL.md);
until then, the `Cargo.toml` version sits at `0.1.0` and unreleased changes
accumulate below.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-31

First public release of yolop — a minimal terminal coding agent built on
[`everruns-runtime`](https://crates.io/crates/everruns-runtime).

### Highlights

- **Terminal coding agent.** A ratatui-based TUI that drives the everruns
  runtime agent loop, with live streaming of delta events as the model works.
- **Provider setup built in.** `/provider`, `/token`, and `/onboard` commands
  configure OpenAI or Anthropic and persist settings to TOML; OpenAI is the
  default provider, Anthropic the secondary.
- **Session persistence.** Reasoning artifacts and the session log are
  persisted, so sessions can be resumed with `--session`.
- **Skills and personalization.** Skills are sourced from workspace, global,
  and system scopes; a personalization layer adds a central memory surface.
- **Offline smoke testing.** The bundled `llmsim` provider runs the full loop
  with no API key (`yolop --provider llmsim -p "hi"`).
